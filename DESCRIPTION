Description: Builds a LASSO, Ridge, or Elastic Net model with glmnet or
    cv.glmnet with bootstrap inference statistics (SE, CI, and p-value)
    for selected coefficients with no shrinkage applied for them. Model
    performance can be evaluated on test data and an automated alpha
    selection is implemented for Elastic Net. Parallelized computation is
    used to speed up the process.
