Description: Builds a LASSO, Ridge, or Elastic Net model with 'glmnet' or
    'cv.glmnet' (Friedman, Hastie, Tibshirani 2010; Simon, Friedman,
    Hastie, Tibshirani 2011) with bootstrap inference statistics (SE, CI,
    and p-value) for selected coefficients with no shrinkage applied for
    them. Model performance can be evaluated on test data and an automated
    alpha selection is implemented for Elastic Net.  Parallelized
    computation is used to speed up the process.
