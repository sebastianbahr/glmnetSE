  New submission
  Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    glmnetSE (3:8)
  
  The Title field should be in title case. Current version is:
    glmnet (3:38)
  'glmnetSE: Add Bootstrap SE to glmnet for Selected Coefficients (No Shrinkage)'
  The Title field starts with the package name.
  In title case that is:
  'glmnetSE: Add Bootstrap SE to Glmnet for Selected Coefficients (No Shrinkage)'
  
  Author's comments: 
  1. The package name is indeed "glmnetSE"
  2. glmnet is not written in capital letters because I am refering to the package "glmnet"
