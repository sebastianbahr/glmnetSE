\title{glmnetSE: Add bootstrap SE to glmnet for selected coefficients (no shrinkage)}
\usage{
glmnetSE(
  data,
  cf.no.shrnkg,
  alpha = 1,
  method = "none",
  r = 100,
  nlambda = 100,
  seed = 0,
  family = "gaussian",
  type = "basic",
  conf = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, tibble or matrix object with the outcome variable in the first column and the feature variables in the following columns.}

\item{cf.no.shrnkg}{A character string of the coefficients that will be interpreted, the inference statistic is of interest and therefore no shrinkage will be applied.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha value 1 for LASSO and 0 for Ridge.}

\item{method}{A character string defining if no 10-fold cross validation "none", 10-fold cross validation and selecting the lambda at which the MSE is within one standard error of the smallest MSE  "10CVoneSE", or 10-fold cross validation and selecting the lambda at which the smallest MSE is achieved "10CVmin" - default is "none.}

\item{r}{Number of bootstrap repetitions -default is 100.}

\item{nlambda}{Number of tested lambda values - default is 100.}

\item{seed}{Seed set for the bootstrap sampling - default 0 which means no seed set.}

\item{family}{A character string representing the used model family either "gaussian" or "binomial" - default is "gaussian".}

\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of calculated bootstrap intervals. It can be "norm", "basic", "stud", "perc", "bca". For more information check the "boot.ci" package - default is "basic".}

\item{conf}{Indicates the confidence interval level - default is 0.95.}
}
\value{
A data frame with all coefficients, confidence intervals and information about significance of the effect for the coefficients of interesst.
}
\description{
glmnet or cv.glmnet with bootstrap standard errors for selected coefficients with no shrinkage applied for them.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# GAUSSIAN with no cross validation and coefficient of interest is Education
glmnetSE(data=swiss,cf.no.shrnkg = c("Education"), alpha=1, method="none", r=100, seed = 123, family="gaussian")


# BINOMIAL with 10-fold cross validation selecting the lambda at which the
# smallest MSE is achieved, 500 bootstrap repetitions and coefficient of interest
# are Education and Catholic.
glmnetSE(data=swiss,cf.no.shrnkg = c("Education", "Catholic"), alpha=1, method="10CVmin", r=500, seed = 123, family="binomial")
